Abstract:

With the rise of new viral pathogens posing a threat to humanity, accurate taxonomic classification is essential to better understand their characteristics. Existing alignment-based bioinformatic methods for taxonomic classification are often time-consuming, while alignment-free methods suffer from low predictive performance. To address this issue, we have developed a robust alignment-free computational method based on genomic sequences of existing pathogens to classify new viral pathogens such as Sars-Cov-2 using machine learning (ML) models at varying taxonomic levels.  Using a combination of Shannon’s Entropy and Discrete Fourier Transforms, two pre-existing features based on the unique intrinsic genomic signatures present in DNA sequences, we formed a new feature we coined “magtropy”. When used as a metric in the ML model, magtropy increased the overall predictive power, especially in the highest (most diverse) taxonomic level and the lowest (least diverse) taxonomic level. The predictive power of this feature was further enhanced by the use of a unique fractal-based metric derived from the DNA walk corresponding to viral genomic sequences.
